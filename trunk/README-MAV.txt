================================================================================
CasparCG Server 2.0.3
MAV Edition
================================================================================

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

This does require a preety beefy machine, although machines as specified by SVT
(http://casparcg.com/wiki/CasparCG_Server#System_Requirements) should do just
fine at least for one (in- and out-) channel.

INSTALLATION
============

Follow the instalation procedures from README.txt. If this is your first
installation of a CasparCG Server, please try installing a normal version,
and learn how to use CasparCG first. I recomend using the MAV Edition only for
people already fluent in CasparCG.

CONFIGURATION
=============

The casparcg.config has been modified, to specifically target the MAV edition.
Note the two channels. The minimal configuration for the MAV edition requires
at least two channels: one for ingest and another one for output. This usually
means two Decklink cards: one for input, and another one for output.

Beyond that you can have multiple input and output channels, in various
configurations. Always have only one replay buffer per ingest channel.

 * Configure all ingest channels as empty channels with proper system modes
   (f.g. PAL or 1080i50000). Leave the consumers tag empty.

 * Configure all output channels as porper channels, like you normally would,
   f.g. with Decklink consumers.

 * Start the server

 * Play the input from your ingest decklink card on your ingest channel:
      play 1 decklink 1

 * Add the replay consumer to your ingest channel:
      add 1 replay test-replay

   The "test-replay" is a file-name for your replay buffer. Two files will be
   created in your CasparCG "media" folder: a TEST-REPLAY.MAV file and a
   TEST-REPLAY.IDX file. The first one is the video essence, and the second
   one is a manifest and index file. Should you copy your replay buffers,
   always copy both files.

 * Play your replay buffer on your output channel:
      play 2 test-replay

 * Voila! You have your own replay system.

You can seek within your replay buffer using the CALL ACMP 2.0 command:

      call 2 seek 100

This will seek to the 100th frame in the replay buffer

      call 2 seek |100

This will seek to the 100th frame from the end in the replay buffer

      call 2 seek +50

This will move the playhead of your replay 50 frames forward

      call 2 seek -50

This will move the playhead of your replay 50 frames backward


You can also change the speed of your playback (this is somewhat wonky
right now):

      call 2 speed 1

Will make the playback go at normal speed

      call 2 speed -2

Will make the playback go backwards at twice the normal speed

      call 2 speed 0.5

Will make the playback go at half the speed

      call 2 speed 0.75

Will make the playback go at 3/4 of normal speed
